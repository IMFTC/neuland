** About
   Neuland is a Tox chat client for the GNOME desktop. It is *not*
   officially part of GNOME or Tox. Neuland is written in C and still
   in an early stage of development. There has not been a release yet;
   if you want to test Neuland you have to build it from git.

   *Contributors are welcome!*

   For Tox see https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore.

   For GNOME see https://www.gnome.org.

** Building Neuland from Source

*** Requirements
    Neuland requires toxcore from git master and the latest
    gtk+-3.13.x (which will be released as gtk+-3.14 soon).

*** Building and installing
    Neuland uses Autotools. Compile and install Neuland from a fresh
    git checkout with:

    ./autogen.sh && make && make install

    If you are using custom locations you can set PKG_CONFIG_PATH and
    pass the usual Autotools configure options such as --prefix to
    autogen.sh (they will be passed on to ./configure).
