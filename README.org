* Neuland!

  [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMFTC/neuland/master/screenshot.png]]

** About
   Neuland is a Tox chat client for the GNOME desktop.  It is *not*
   officially part of GNOME or Tox.  Neuland is written in C and still
   in an early stage of development.  *There has not been a release
   yet*; if you want to test Neuland you have to build it from git.

   *Contributors are welcome!*

   For Tox see https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore.

   For GNOME see https://www.gnome.org.

** Current Status
   Neuland is not ready for normal usage yet.  It is very likely that
   it has bugs that destroy your data or your system.  Therefore, you
   should only use it if you want to contribute and make it better!

*** *DONE* Items
    - Sending contact requests
    - Receiving and accepting contact requests
    - Deleting contacts
    - Basic chat
    - File transfer (*KNOWN BUG:* When choosing to replace an existing file,
      data is appended to that file, instead of replacing it!)

*** *TODO* Items
    - .desktop file
    - Settings (Neuland doesn't save anything at all yet, it merely
      uses toxcore's save function to load and save toxcore's data.)
    - Chat log
    - Support for Avatars
    - Audio support
    - Video support
    - /And much more .../

** Building Neuland from Source

*** Requirements
    - toxcore (git master branch)
    - gtk+-3.14

*** Building and installing
    Neuland uses Autotools.  Compile and install it from a fresh git
    checkout with:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ ./autogen.sh && make && make install
    #+END_SRC
    If you are using custom locations you can set PKG_CONFIG_PATH and
    pass the usual Autotools configure options such as --prefix to
    autogen.sh (they will be passed on to ./configure).

** Launching Neuland
   For safety reasons Neuland uses its own configuration file by
   default, which is =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tox/data.neuland=. If you want
   Neuland use your default tox configuration file instead, you can
   specify it on the command line:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ neuland ~/.config/tox/data
   #+END_SRC
   Passing multiple configuration files to neuland will open a
   separate Neuland window for each configuration file; this is useful
   for testing. For example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   $ neuland ~/.config/tox/my_test_data{1,2}
   #+END_SRC
   will open one window for my_test_data1 and a second one for
   my_test_data2.
