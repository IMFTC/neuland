* Neuland!

** About
   Neuland is a chat client for Tox, mainly targeting the GNOME
   desktop.

   For more information about Tox see https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore.

   For more information about GNOME see https://www.gnome.org.

** Requirements
   Neuland requires toxcore and gtk+-3.13.x (which will be released as
   gtk+-3.14 soon).

** Installation
   Compile and install Neuland from a fresh git checkout with:

   ./autogen.sh && make && make install

   You can set PKG_CONFIG_PATH and pass the usual Autotools configure
   options such as --prefix to autogen.sh (they will be passed on to
   ./configure) if your toxcore and gtk+ installs reside in custom
   locations.
